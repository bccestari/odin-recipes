        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Yakisoba is the Japanese variety of fried noodles. Originating from the Chinese chow main, these noodles are usually mixed with a variety of meat and vegetables. Japanese favorites are usually pork, cabbage, onions, and carrots. The most common noodle varieties used in the dish are ramen noodles (made with wheat flour) or soba noodles (made with buckwheat).</p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>4 (8 ounce) packages buckwheat soba noodles</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound pork tenderloin, cut against the grain in thin strips</li>
            <li>2 cups carrots, cut into julienne strips</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, cut into julienne strips</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>half head napa cabbage, shredded</li>
            <li>two thirds of cup yakisoba sauce</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons pickled red ginger (beni shoga), or to taste</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons kizami nori (dried flaked aonori seaweed), or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook soba in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water. Set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat oil in a wok over medium heat. Add pork and stir-fry with a pinch of salt and pepper, about 5 minutes. Transfer meat to a plate, reserving oil in wok. Add carrots, onion, ginger, and garlic to the wok and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add cabbage to the wok and stir-fry briefly, about 1 minute. Add drained soba noodles. Pour in 1/2 the yakisoba sauce and stir-fry until noodles and vegetables are covered with sauce, about 3 minutes. Return pork to the wok. Add additional sauce as desired. Remove from heat.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Garnish yakisoba with kizami nori and a small pile of beni shoga just before serving.</li>
        </ol>
